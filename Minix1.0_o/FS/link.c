/* This file handles the LINK and UNLINK system calls.  It also deals with
 * deallocating the storage used by a file when the last UNLINK is done to a
 * file and the blocks must be returned to the free block pool.
 *
 * The entry points into this file are
 *   do_link:	perform the LINK system call
 *   do_unlink:	perform the UNLINK system call
 *   truncate:	release all the blocks associated with an inode
